# OpenInPrivateWindowAHK
This will open any link within the Brave Browser (and probably some others) inside a private window, keeping your main browser clear of filling up with other history and leaving you targeted online.

# Things you need:
- A mouse with a side button that is mapped to Right Control

# How to use it:
Hold down the side button on your mouse that is mapped to right control (if your mouse software doesn't do this or your mouse doesn't have software, you could probably use AutoHotKey) and left click on the link you want to open in a private window.
